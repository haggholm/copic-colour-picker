# Copic Colour Picker

Quick and dirty colour picker for Copic markers.

The JSON data for colours were nabbed from https://www.swatchtool.com/copic.

Type an RGB value into the input field, e.g.
`123,200,65` or `#ff08a2` and select a colour space
(RGB, HSV, Lab).

The code is awful. This is a quick and dirty tool just to, well, pick out
marker colours, not set up a long-term software project.
